Rainmeter Plugin for showing song info from Media Players.

### Warning
With so many changes on how the ```NowPlaying``` plugin works in Rainmeter, some integrations are not working as of right now, which is:
* Album label & cover
* Progress Bar
* Player Volume control & System Volume control

(probably some needs a big changes, because these was working perfectly fine before)

P.S: This changes was happened somewhere around 2018

<b>Full Player Support:</b>
* AIMP
* Foobar2000[1]
* iTunes
* J. River Media Center
* Media Jukebox
* MusicBee
* Winamp

<b>Partial Player Support:</b>
* Spotify

# Installation
1. Install the current Rainmeter ```4.2``` or ```4.3 Beta```
2. Download this and extract it to your Rainmeter ```Skins``` folder

# Notes
* <i>Skin will hide when the player is not running, this will be a toggle on the future releases.</i>
* [1] For Foobar2000, please install [foo_cad](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) first, otherwise it won't work. This plugin is not stable on itself, so bear in mind that it can frequently reach the "not responding" state.

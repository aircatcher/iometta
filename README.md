# Installation
1. Install the current Rainmeter ```4.2``` or ```4.3 Beta```
2. Download this and extract it to your Rainmeter ```Skins``` folder

# Notes
* <i>Skin will hide when the player is not running, this will be a toggle on the future releases.</i>
* [1] For Foobar2000, please install [foo_cad](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) first, otherwise it won't work. This plugin is not stable on itself, so bear in mind that it can frequently reach the "not responding" state.

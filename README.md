# Installation
1. Install the current Rainmeter ```4.3.1``` or ```4.4 Beta```
2. Download the latest ```.rmskin``` file on the [release page](https://github.com/fralyx/iometta/releases/latest) and install 

# Notes
* [1] For Foobar2000, please install [foo_cad](https://poiru.net/foo-cad/) first, otherwise it won't work. This plugin is not stable on itself, so bear in mind that it can frequently crash.
* [2] Spotify has removed ```SpotifyWebHelper.exe``` for good, in return, these functions won't work properly, the development of ```NowPlaying``` seems to be abandoned. Here are the list of things that won't work:
  * Album label & cover
  * Progress Bar
  * Player Volume control
  * Play / Pause state
  
  Here I found a guide to aleviate the Web Helper made by [khanhas](https://github.com/khanhas):

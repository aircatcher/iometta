# Installation
1. Install the current Rainmeter ```4.3.1``` or ```4.4 Beta```
2. Download this and extract it to your Rainmeter ```Skins``` folder

# Notes
* [1] For Foobar2000, please install [foo_cad](https://poiru.net/foo-cad/) first, otherwise it won't work. This plugin is not stable on itself, so bear in mind that it can frequently crash.
* [2] Spotify has removed ```SpotifyWebHelper.exe``` for good, in return, these functions won't work properly, following the current Rainmeter's ```NowPlaying``` implementation:
  * Album label & cover
  * Progress Bar
  * Player Volume control
